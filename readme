'Kill Team Dice Combat Simulator'

This is a dice rolling simulator inspired by the the Warhammer 40,000 Kill Team tabletop game.

The game is for 2 players, each starting with an HP value of 14. The game will randomly determine which player has the initiative each turn, 'roll' 3 6-sided dice each, and take turns 'striking' or 'blocking' each other's dice, starting with the player who has the initiative that turn.

A dice is determined 'successful' if it is a value of 3 or higher (3, 4, 5, or 6), other dice are discarded. A successful strike will lower the other player's HP by 3, or a successful critical strike (only applicable to dice with a value of 6), will reduce the other player's HP by 4.

'Blocking' a dice allocates any one of the player's successful dice to remove one of the other player's successful dice, but only a critical (again being a dice with a value of 6) can block another critical.

A player whose HP is reduced to half (7 or lower) is to be considered immediately 'wounded' and can then only count dice with a value of 4 or higher as successful, discarding any dice in their current pool as necessary.

Once both players have allocated all available dice, allowing one player to allocated multiple dice consecutively if their opponent has no dice available, if a winner has not been decided, the initiative is randomized again, a new pool of dice are 'rolled' for each player, and a new turn begins.

The first player to reduce the other player's HP to 0 is the winner.

Bugs to Fix:

-When a player is wounded, it prints the is_wounded line before printing the line that shows the other player dealing damage. Not game-breaking, but aesthetically suboptimal.

-Try to get remaining player dice dynamically adjusted mid-turn in the instance where a player is wounded by a strike if they have any 3s currently in their pool.
